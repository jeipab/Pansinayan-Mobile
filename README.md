**Real-time Filipino Sign Language (FSL) Recognition on Android**

This repository contains the official Android application for **Pansinayan**, a system that translates Filipino Sign Language into text in real-time.
The app uses the device's camera, **MediaPipe** for keypoint extraction, and optimized **TFLite models (Transformer/GRU)** for live inference.

This project provides the complete, production-ready Android scaffolding code and the Python scripts needed to export your own trained models for deployment.

## 🚀 Features

* **Live Recognition:** Uses CameraX for a high-performance, real-time camera feed.
* **Dual-Model Support:** Allows real-time switching between a high-accuracy Transformer model and a lightweight GRU model.
* **Advanced Keypoint Extraction:** Employs MediaPipe for robust extraction of 78 keypoints (pose, left hand, right hand, and face), totaling 156 data points.
* **Skeleton Visualization:** Toggleable skeleton overlay to visualize the keypoints MediaPipe is detecting.
* **Occlusion Detection:** UI indicator shows when the user's hand blocks their face (which can affect accuracy).
* **Persistent History:** All recognitions are saved to a local Room database for review.
* **CSV Export:** Users can export their recognition history as a CSV file for analysis.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The app’s recognition pipeline is designed for high performance and low latency:

```
Camera (CameraX)
   → MediaPipeProcessor (Extracts 156 keypoints)
   → SequenceBufferManager (Builds 90-frame window)
   → TFLiteModelRunner (Runs Transformer/GRU model)
   → TemporalRecognizer (Filters results)
   → UI Update
```

## 🧩 Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio (latest version)
* Android device or Emulator (API 24+)
* Python 3.8+
* Required Python libraries: `torch`, `onnx`, `onnx-tf`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pandas`

---

### Step 1: Export Your Models

Before building the app, export your trained PyTorch models to the TFLite format.

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch onnx onnx-tf tensorflow numpy pandas
```

Run the export script (this converts your models and generates `label_mapping.json`):

```bash
python android/model_export_and_setup.py --model both
```

This will create a folder (e.g. `android/android_models/`) containing:

```
sign_transformer_quant.tflite
sign_mediapipe_gru_quant.tflite
label_mapping.json
```

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Android Project

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Select **File > New > Project from Version Control**, then enter your repository URL.

   * Alternatively, download the ZIP, extract it, and open this folder directly in Android Studio.
3. In the project panel, right-click `app/src/main/` → **New > Folder > Assets Folder** → **Finish**.

---

### Step 3: Copy Model Files

Copy the three generated files from Step 1 into:

```
app/src/main/assets/
```

Files:

* `sign_transformer_quant.tflite`
* `sign_mediapipe_gru_quant.tflite`
* `label_mapping.json`

---

### Step 4: Download MediaPipe Models

The app also requires MediaPipe’s base models for pose and hand tracking.

Download the following files and place them in `app/src/main/assets/`:

* `hand_landmarker.task`
* `pose_landmarker_full.task`

Your `assets/` folder should now contain **five files total**.

---

### Step 5: Build and Run

1. Wait for Android Studio to sync Gradle. If not, click **Sync Project with Gradle Files** (small elephant icon).
2. Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
3. Click the **Run ‘app’** button (green play icon).
4. Grant camera permission when prompted.
